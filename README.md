- 🔭 I’m currently working on ... a disaster response application to identify where people need food, water, electricity and medical care in case of an emergency, so we can help K-12 teachers back to teaching kids living in difficult circumstances.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... how to play Beethoven on a classical guitar, because it helps my brain when I need to do some hard code code. I perform virtually every Monday for my professor in a music conservatory, to keep me on my toes.  
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on ... closing the digital divide for children residing in rural and minority communities.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with ... learning GO. Anyone gamified this yet? Send info.

- 📫 How to reach me: ... message me via LinkedIn @mayorgalu, but be specific and introduce yourself, don't just do creepy requests.
