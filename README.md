<!--
**mayorgalu/mayorgalu** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on ... a disaster response application to identify where people need food, water, electricity and medical care in case of an emergency, so we can help K-12 teachers back to teaching kids living in difficult circumstances.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... how to play Beethoven on a classical guitar, because it helps my brain when I need to do some hard code code. I perform virtually every Monday for my professor in a music conservatory, to keep me on my toes.  
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on ... closing the digital divide for children residing in rural and minority communities.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with ... learning GO. Anyone gamified this yet? Send info.
- 💬 Ask me about ... rescuing snowdogs and learning how to be at peace with the process of any challenge in your life.
- 📫 How to reach me: ... message me via LinkedIn @mayorgalu, but be specific and introduce yourself, don't just do creepy requests.
- 😄 Pronouns: ... She/Her
- ⚡ Fun fact: ... I practice mindful surfing, I teach yoga and mindfulness to really stressed out kids. Did you know you can meditate while you code?
