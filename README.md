### Nice to meet you,

- ⛑👩‍🏫 I’m currently working on ... an open source GIS Geospatial voice to text disaster response application to identify where people need food, water, electricity, and medical care in case of an emergency to help K-12 teachers get back to teaching kids living in difficult circumstances.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... how to play Beethoven on a classical guitar, the dexterity helps my brain when I need to code long hours. I perform virtually every Monday for my music conservatory professor, it keeps my fingers nimble and my music skills fresh. 

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on ...closing the digital divide for children residing in rural and minority communities, improving access to education, and access to amazing teachers. 

- 🤔 I’m looking for help with ... learning GO and causing an impact in public policy using technology.
